# Using ManeFrame II (M2)

A dedicated queue has been setup for Think-Play-Hack, "tph". This queue has 10 nodes, each with 36-cores and 256 GB memory. Two of the nodes also have a NVIDIA P100 GPU with 16 GB of memory. The guest accounts are restricted to the "tph" queue.

2. On M2 run: `export MODULEPATH="${MODULEPATH}:/hpc/modules/tph" && module --ignore-cache load python_jupyter r_rstudio`

## R with RStudio

### Using Guest Account

1. On M2 run: `srun -p tph -c 1 --mem=6G m2_rstudio`
2. Wait for about 30 seconds *after* the job is allocated and then follow the port forwarding instructions that will be given in the output.

### Using SMU Account

1. On M2 run: `srun -p tph -A tph -c 1 --mem=6G m2_rstudio` All other queues can be used and, if so, remove the `-A tph` flag.
