# Think-Play-Hack: World Views

## Preparatory Readings

Dr. Guldi has compiled a list of readings to get your creative juices flowing. You can find them [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ru4dxh6rr6uqvfl/AADlPVWVEZ1BE4OcxPnZ0dpDa?dl=0).

## [Slack Instructions](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/212675257)

You likely recieved an invitation to our Slack channel. This will be a good way to communicate with people at the conference and ask the Data Team questions if you need to. If you did not get an invite, just ask and we can send you one.

## [GitHub Instructions](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

Though not required to use this repository, having an account on GitHub is a good idea for any programmer. It provides you with a portfolio of projects you have worked on as well as a way to collaborate with other coders.

It will also allow you to clone this repository as well as add issues and suggest changes for the data team.

## Software

We have ready-to-go software stacks for Python with Jupyter and R with RStudio.

### [Docker Setup for Personal Machines](docs/docker.md)

Docker is a tool that allows software to run on your computer without actually needing to install the full software. These instructions will guide you through setting up Docker and getting our image running on your personal machine.

We have provided two images: one that runs R and RStudio and one that runs Python, Jupyter Notebooks and JupyterLab.

### [Using ManeFrame II (M2)](docs/m2.md)

[ManeFrame II (M2)](http://faculty.smu.edu/csc/documentation/about.html) is SMU's high performance computing (HPC) cluster. M2 features 11,000 cores, 60 NVIDIA V100 and P100 GPU accelerators, and 256 GB, 768 GB, and 1.5 TB memory configurations per node. Guest accounts on the cluster can be requested [here](https://smu.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2i6o7BztWg52rK5).

## [Data on Box](https://smu.box.com/s/2exvlyqgiouhbrghytzwxr5l25ybmx2b)

We have provided access to all the data for the event on Box. Given the size, consider what you might want to work on prior to downloading it. Should you have trouble, we have flash drives and hard drives with the data stored locally as well.

## [Reddit](reddit.md)
We have over 1 TB of reddit data available in a database. You can [get subsets of this data](reddit.md) for analysis.

## Think Prompts

In case you are having trouble getting started:

1. Can one imagine developing a method to trace narrative elements across genres? How would you formalize "narrative element"?

2. How do we align narrative elements with aspects of cultural ideology (norms, beliefs, values)?

3. What aspects of storytelling can we map? To what end? (i.e. can you imagine a new historic-geographic methodology?)

4. What impact do popular films (e.g. Snow White and the 7 Dwarves) have on traditional tales (and vice versa)?

5. Can we discover/trace the impact of traditional stories on literary works such as The Hobbit? On films?

6. Where did you find that lovely frosted mug filled with such an alluringly amber-hewed frothy brew? Were there nuts as well?
